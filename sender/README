This small collection of things is intended to run on Raspberry Pi.
It will read temperature data from 3 DS18B20 probles conencted via
the one-wire bus and temperature and humidity data from a DHT22
connected to GPIO 7.

Setup

In /boot/config add

  dtoverlay=w1-gpio

In /etc/modules add

  w1-gpio
  w1-therm

That is all that is needed for DS18B20 support.

To add support for the DHT22 then some more setup is neeed.
